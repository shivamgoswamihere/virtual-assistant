# Virtual Assistant ü§ñ (UNDER PROGRESS)

The current features of the program are
- recognize English language üìë
- gives back witty replies
- control the computer functions üõÇ
- works on commands ‚öí

This is not an AI. For now, the commands 
are mostly pre-determined with a pinch of
 chatbot but it still gets the job done.üëç
  I am planning to incorporate AI, ML, and NLP 
  in the future. It showcases the current
   features and possibilities of the 
   project.

My goal is to make the Program a complete
 A.I. that can also understand Natural 
 Language and has Machine Language too.
  I have many ideas but I am limited by 
  my knowledge.

### Features

- Speech Recognition
- Greeting according to time
- works according to instructions
- dual language support
